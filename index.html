                And when it takes less than a second (0.62 to be exact) for about 1,300,000,000 results to pop up on the screen, you can be forgiven for thinking ‘nope, too hard’.
                
                There’s so much information coming our way. It’s overwhelming. And how do we know whether the stuff we’re reading is trustworthy and backed by experts?
                
                That’s why we created the new home of healthy in Australia - healthylife.</p>
