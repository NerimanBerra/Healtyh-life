                            Keeping track of your body weight on a daily or weekly basis will help you see what you’re losing and/or what
                            you’re gaining.
                            2. Limit Unhealthy Foods and Eat Healthy Meals
                            Do not forget to eat breakfast and choose a nutritious meal with more protein and fiber and less fat, sugar, and
                            calories. For more information on weight-control foods and dietary recommendations, please check the following
